# WebVR-AFrame-IPMEDT3

```February 1st 2020```

## Scope/Purpose

This project was created as part of a course I followed for my bachelor in Computer Science. The main goal was to create 
a WebVR app with the A-Frame framework for the University of Applied Sciences in Leiden. It would be used to teach the general
concept of the determination of bacteria.

In this VR environment, the student would navigate though small and simple tasks where it would require the thought process which 
would be needed in a real lab. Due to limitations, only the general concept could be covered and not the real steps which would 
take place within a real lab.

## The VR Environment

You can try the virtual environment for yourself at: https://webvr-aframe.web.app/ 

Use:

- Navigate by using (clicking) the black tiles on the floor
- Use the cursor to click on certain items to pick them up
- Click on levers, light bulbs (to get a hint) or red circles (for placing certain items) to interact with them

Clicking - when the cursor is shirking your in the fusing event, during this time you can cancel the click by looking away

Note: The app can be used with an mobile phone inside a Google Cardboard or other Mobile VR headsets, but can also be used 
with an Oculus, HTC or other VR headsets (Some location adjustments are needed for optimal navigation).

Disclaimer: This program is not a full release for commercial use and the whole application is made with the Dutch language in mind.
